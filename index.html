They could've heard words of anger and discord. Those are not just American ideas, they are human rights, and that is why we will support them everywhere.</p>
		  <p>But by the time he was a young adult, he was an atheist. For we have a choice in this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. It's been about you. Too many tears have flowed. This is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work.</p>
		  <p>Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development in Muslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to the marketplace so they can create jobs. There is so much fear, so much mistrust.</p>
		  <p>Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn - they know that parents have to teach, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. And that it's not enough to just believe this - we have to do our part to make it a reality. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. And just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank.</p>
		  <p>Not this time. "And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back."</p>
		  <p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p> </div>

<p>And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents - I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives. That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest.</p></div>

				<p>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise. We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribus unum: "Out of many, one."</p></div>
